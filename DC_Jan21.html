<!--Add CSS to test2.scss to make the background of the body a shade of light grey.-->
<!-- Did it work? -->

<!-- Add an <h1> selector to center the text and style with greenyellow color. -->
<!-- Careful! -->


<!-- Change the achor link to the UChicago homepage, -->
<!-- get rid of the old-fashioned underline, -->
<!-- and make it change color from normal to white -->
<!-- when the mouse hovers over it. -->
<!-- For this we need to use a pseudo-class selector a:hover -->
<a href="https://uchicago.edu">UChicago</a>

<!-- Center the following paragraph on the page, -->
<!-- make the first letter double XL and in greenyellow color -->
<!-- For this wee need to use a pseudo-element p::first-letter -->
<p>Here's a paragraph</p>

<!-- Style the paragraph in the div below. -->
<!-- The XL first letter should be blue -->
<!-- The previous paragraph must not change! -->

<div>
  <p>
    This is a paragraph in a div
  </p>
</div>

<!-- SCSS Tasks: -->
<!-- Nest the :hover pseudo-class selector -->
<!-- Nest the ::first-letter pseud-element selectors -->
<!-- Assign greenyellow to a variable and use it in the stylesheet -->
<!-- Import padding settings from a partial SCSS file. -->
<!-- Compare scss and css -->
